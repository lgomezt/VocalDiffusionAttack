    "# Audio Quality\n",
    "We will use **PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality)**, **STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility)**, and **DNSMOS (Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score)** to evaluate audio quality after watermark removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PESQ** is a metric designed to simulate human perception of speech quality. It compares a reference (clean) signal to a degraded (processed) one, taking into account perceptual distortion, time alignment, and other audio artifacts. PESQ is widely used in audio codec evaluation and speech processing tasks. It is part of the ITU-T P.862 standard. The PESQ score typically ranges from 1.0 (bad quality) to 4.5 (excellent quality), with higher values indicating better perceived audio quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STOI** is a metric that estimates how intelligible a piece of speech is to human listeners. Unlike PESQ, which focuses on overall perceptual quality, STOI is specifically designed to predict the understandability of speech. It operates on short-time overlapping windows and compares the clean and processed signals. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better intelligibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNSMOS** is a non-intrusive, deep learning-based metric that estimates the quality of speech signals without requiring a reference audio. It predicts four scores: `ovrl_mos` (overall speech quality), `sig_mos` (speech signal quality), `bak_mos` (background noise quality), and `p808_mos` (an advanced perceptual metric). It is particularly useful in scenarios like speech enhancement or watermark removal where a clean reference is unavailable or hard to align. All scores typically range from 1 to 5, with higher being better.\n",
